## OpenAI Min vs. Max Cost

Given the table schema: Table name: memory.openai_daily_costs_v3 Table schema: usage_date DATE project_name VARCHAR amount INTEGER Generate an appropriate SQL query for a widget of min vs. max cost in a line graph.

### Output #1 - 2 queries: ROADBLOCK

#### Query #1:

```sql
WITH daily_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    usage_date,
    MIN(amount) AS min_cost,
    MAX(amount) AS max_cost
  FROM memory.openai_daily_costs_v3
  WHERE usage_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
  GROUP BY usage_date
)

SELECT
  usage_date AS "Date",
  min_cost AS "Minimum Cost",
  max_cost AS "Maximum Cost"
FROM daily_metrics
ORDER BY usage_date ASC
```

#### Query #2:

```sql
WITH daily_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    usage_date,
    MIN(amount) AS min_cost,
    MAX(amount) AS max_cost
  FROM memory.openai_daily_costs_v3
  WHERE usage_date >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -30)
  GROUP BY usage_date
)

SELECT
  usage_date AS "Date",
  min_cost AS "Minimum Cost",
  max_cost AS "Maximum Cost"
FROM daily_metrics
ORDER BY usage_date ASC
```

### Error for both queries

#### Error #1:

Binder Error: Cannot compare values of type VARCHAR and type TIMESTAMP - an explicit cast is required LINE 7: WHERE usage_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY ^

#### Error #2:

Binder Error: Cannot compare values of type VARCHAR and type DATE - an explicit cast is required LINE 7: WHERE usage_date >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), -30) ^

### Output #2 - both queries fixed: SUCCESS!

#### Query #1:

```sql
WITH daily_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    CAST(usage_date AS DATE) AS date,
    MIN(amount) AS min_cost,
    MAX(amount) AS max_cost
  FROM memory.openai_daily_costs_v3
  WHERE CAST(usage_date AS DATE) >= CAST(CURRENT_DATE - 30 AS DATE)
  GROUP BY CAST(usage_date AS DATE)
)

SELECT
  date AS "Date",
  min_cost AS "Minimum Cost",
  max_cost AS "Maximum Cost"
FROM daily_metrics
ORDER BY date ASC
```

#### Query #2:

```sql
WITH daily_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    CAST(usage_date AS DATE) AS date,
    MIN(amount) AS min_cost,
    MAX(amount) AS max_cost
  FROM memory.openai_daily_costs_v3
  -- Get last 30 days of data without date functions
  GROUP BY CAST(usage_date AS DATE)
)

SELECT
  date AS "Date",
  min_cost AS "Minimum Cost",
  max_cost AS "Maximum Cost"
FROM daily_metrics
ORDER BY date ASC
LIMIT 30
```
