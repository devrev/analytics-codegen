# Ideas for BQP

See use-cases below, and corresponding instructions for successful query generation:

## OpenAI Min vs. Max Cost

### Idea #1:

Identify source tables containing cost data.
Create CTEs for each data source with consistent columns (date, identifier, aggregated cost).
Cast date fields to consistent data types in all operations.
Combine sources using UNION ALL.
Filter by desired time range (with proper type casting).
Order results chronologically for visualization.

### Idea #2:

Begin with basic query structure (CTEs for each source, UNION ALL, date filtering).
Add explicit CAST to date comparison in WHERE clause after type mismatch error.
Cast usage_date fields to DATE type in both source CTEs and WHERE clause to resolve VARCHAR vs DATE comparison issue.
Verify query executes without type errors and produces correct comparison data.

## Compare Cost AWS vs. OpenAI

### Idea #1:

Identify functions not supported by your specific database engine.
Replace with equivalent database-specific syntax or standard SQL alternatives.
Check column data types and add explicit casts for type mismatches.
Ensure consistent data types on both sides of comparisons and joins.
Apply identical transformations to columns used in GROUP BY clauses.
Maintain your query's fundamental structure and business logic.
Consider alternative approaches when built-in functions aren't available.
Preserve meaningful column aliases for reporting consistency.
Test incrementally after each change to isolate new issues.
Develop a simpler fallback query when complex operations fail.

### Idea #2:

Identify unsupported functions for your SQL dialect.
Replace with database-specific or standard SQL alternatives.
Check for data type mismatches in comparisons and joins.
Add explicit CAST operations where type conversions are needed.
Apply consistent transformations in SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY clauses.
Consider alternative approaches that avoid problematic functions.
Simplify queries to use the most basic compatible syntax.
Maintain the core business logic throughout revisions.
Preserve meaningful column aliases for reporting/visualization.
Ensure proper sorting in the final result set.
Use pagination (LIMIT, OFFSET) when date filtering fails.
Test each change incrementally to pinpoint errors.
Document working patterns for future reference.
